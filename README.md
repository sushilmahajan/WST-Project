## How it Works
1. User first has to register with valid mail id
2. User can add products for sale or buy from available products
3. He can search for a particular product through all products or category wise also (There are 6 categories)
4. Product details are shown category wise & comments can be added.
5. User can see anyone's profile & can edit his own.
6. Before buying product, it has to be added to cart.
7. When buyer clicks Buy, request is sent to seller through mail.
8. Seller can either accept request or just ignore (Note : He should be logged in while accepting)
9. Once seller accepts, a pass is sent to buyer (Note : Deal is not completed)
10. In order to verify transaction & generate receipt, Seller should mark product as sold to a buyer by entering pass provided by him.
11. If pass matches, transaction is confirmed, a receipt is generated & mailed to both parties and product shifts to History.
